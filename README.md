Project from "Combinatorics on words" course. <br> <br>
We created a game called "Off-diagonal Van der Waerden online". There are two players: the computer and you. 
Your goal is to build a string consisting of n tokens using r colors.
The computer chooses the place where you have to insert the token.
Then you choose the color of the token.
Your task is to prevent the formation of a monochromatic arithmetic progression with a given length
for each color. <br><br>
Can you beat the computer? <br>
Good luck and have fun!
